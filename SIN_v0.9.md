# Statement of Inclusive Neutrality v0.9

## Conditions of Inclusion

Our aim is that everyone, regardless of identity, ideology, or background, should feel welcome in our community. A person's inclusion here is not contingent on ideological alignment, but on their commitment to respectful behavior in the spaces of the project.

## Non-Favoritism in Moderation

We recognize that ideological diversity exists within all groups, including those traditionally marginalized or protected. True inclusivity for all members, including the most marginalized, is upheld by fostering civility and kindness without favoritism. Moderation decisions will focus solely on users' adherence to the norms of civility and kindness in the spaces of the project.

We encourage all members to share their perspectives, including dissenting ones, as long as they do so respectfully. We encourage members to always bear in mind that agreement with one another is not necessary.

## Operational Assumption of Good Faith

We expect all participants to act as though others in these spaces are engaging in good faith. Focusing on the content of contributions, rather than speculating on intent, ensures that dialogue remains constructive.
