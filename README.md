# Statement of Inclusive Neutrality

## Introduction

The **Statement of Inclusive Neutrality** is intended to be used for projects both large and small to help your audience/members know what to expect about the values you hold, and how people in the community will be treated. It is a set of principles designed to foster an inclusive and respectful environment for any kind of project involving an audience, such as a FOSS software project, or a video game. It provides assurance that participation in, and access to, the project's community is not contingent on ideological alignment, but rather on adherence to norms of respectful behavior.

This repository hosts different versions of the statement, each representing a snapshot of how the principles have evolved over time. You can adopt, adapt, or reference these statements for your own projects to establish clear expectations for community behavior and moderation.

### How to Use

- You are welcome to use the latest version or select an earlier one that best aligns with your project’s goals.
- To adopt a version, simply copy the relevant file to your project’s root directory or documentation, or link to this repository.
